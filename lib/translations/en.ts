Body fat percentage is calculated using measurements like waist, neck, height, and sometimes gender, as fat distribution differs between men and women. For example, if a man’s result is 18%, it means 18% of his body weight is fat. Interpretation: For men, 6–13% is considered Athletic, 14–17% Fit, 18–24% Average, and 25% or more Overweight. For women, 14–20% is Athletic, 21–24% Fit, 25–31% Average, and 32% or more Overweight. Maintaining a healthy body fat percentage improves energy, metabolism, and overall well-being.

          a: "Body fat percentage is the proportion of fat to your total body weight. It shows how much of your weight is made up of fat compared to lean mass, like muscles, bones, and organs. This is an important metric for assessing overall health and fitness, as it gives a clearer picture than just your weight alone."

        {
          q: "How accurate is the body fat calculator?",
          a: "The body fat calculator provides a reliable estimate based on scientifically validated formulas, such as the U.S. Navy method. However, it's essential to note that the results are estimates and may not be as precise as more advanced methods, such as DEXA scans or hydrostatic weighing."

        {
          q: "Do I need any special equipment to use the body fat calculator?",
          a: "No, the body fat calculator only requires basic body measurements like waist, neck, and hip (for women), along with height and weight. These measurements can be taken with a standard tape measure, making the calculator easy and accessible for anyone to use at home."
        },
        {
          q: "How often should I use the body fat calculator?",
          a: "You can use the body fat calculator as often as you'd like to track your progress. Many people use it monthly or after completing specific fitness goals, such as weight loss or muscle gain, to monitor changes in body composition."
        },
        {
          q: "What is considered a healthy body fat percentage?",
          a: "Healthy body fat percentages vary based on age and gender. Generally, for men, a healthy range is between 10-20%, while for women, it's between 20-30%. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare or fitness professional to determine what's healthiest for your individual goals."

          q: "What is the formula behind BMI?",
          a: "The formula is simple and standard: BMI = weight (kg) ÷ [height (m)]² For users who prefer imperial units, the adjusted version is: BMI = 703 × weight (lbs) ÷ [height (in)]² Both versions deliver accurate results for quick health analysis."

Eating fewer calories (e.g., 1,700) creates a calorie deficit and leads to weight loss, while eating more (e.g., 2,700) creates a surplus and leads to weight gain. Remember, 1 pound of fat is roughly equal to 3,500 calories, so a daily deficit of 500 calories can help you lose about 1 pound per week.

It helps you understand how much energy you need to maintain, lose, or gain weight. The formula is: TDEE = BMR × Activity Level. For example, if your BMR is 1600 calories and your activity multiplier is 1.55 (moderate exercise), your TDEE = 1600 × 1.55 = 2480 calories per day. Interpretation: To maintain your current weight, eat around 2480 calories daily. To lose weight, consume fewer calories than your TDEE; to gain weight, eat more. Remember, TDEE varies by individual factors like age, gender, and lifestyle, so use it as a guide and consult a nutrition expert for personalized advice.",
