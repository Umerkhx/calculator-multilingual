The Body Fat Calculator by VastCalculator helps you measure your body fat percentage using key body metrics like weight, height, age, and gender. Unlike BMI, which only considers height and weight, this calculator provides a deeper look at your body composition, giving you a clearer picture of your muscle versus fat ratio. For a complete health comparison, compare your body fat percentage with your BMI for full analysis.",
